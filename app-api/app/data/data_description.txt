Records: 4303
Columns: 18 (17 Features + 1 Target)


There are 3 types of input features:

Objective: factual information;
Examination: results of medical examination;
Subjective: information given by the patient.


Features of Dataset:
Age | Objective | years | Age of the patient
Gender | Objective | null | Gender of the patient
BMI | Objective | null | Body Mass Index of the patient
SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure) | Examination | mmHg | Measures pressure in arteries during heartbeats; high levels can indicate cardiovascular risk in diabetics.
DBP (Diastolic Blood Pressure) | Examination | mmHg | Measures pressure in arteries between heartbeats; elevated levels can suggest vascular complications in diabetics.
FPG (Fasting Plasma Glucose) | Examination | mmol/L | Measures blood sugar levels after fasting; crucial for diagnosing and monitoring diabetes.
FFPG (Final Fasting Plasma Glucose) | Examination | mmol/L | Measures final blood sugar levels after fasting; essential for confirming diabetes diagnosis.
Cholesterol | Examination | mmol/L | Total cholesterol levels in blood; high levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in diabetics.
Triglyceride | Examination | mmol/L | Measures blood triglycerides; elevated levels are linked to insulin resistance and diabetes.
HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) | Examination | mmol/L | Measures "good" cholesterol; higher levels are protective against heart disease in diabetics.
LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) | Examination | mmol/L | Measures "bad" cholesterol; high levels increase cardiovascular risk in diabetes patients.
ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) | Examination | Units/L | Measures liver enzyme levels; elevated ALT can indicate liver dysfunction, common in diabetes.
BUN (Blood urea nitrogen) | Examination | mmol/L | Measures kidney function; high BUN can signal kidney complications in diabetes.
CCR (Creatinine Clearance) | Examination | ml/second | Assesses kidney function by measuring creatinine clearance rate; important for detecting diabetic nephropathy.
Smoking Status: (1: Current Smoker, 2: Ever Smoker, 3: Never Smoker) | Subjective | Indicates smoking habits; smoking exacerbates diabetes complications and cardiovascular risk
Drinking Status: (1: Current Drinker, 2: Ever Drinker, 3: Never Drinker) | Subjective | Indicates alcohol consumption; excessive drinking can affect blood sugar control and liver function in diabetics.
Family History of Diabetes: (1: Yes, 0: No) | Subjective | Indicates genetic predisposition; family history is a significant risk factor for developing diabetes.
Diabetes | Target variable


Description: This dataset is the output of a Chinese research study conducted in 2016. It includes 1304 samples of patients who tested positive for diabetes, and the age of the participants ranges from 21 to 99 years old. The dataset was collected according to the indicators and standards of the World Health Organization, making it a reliable source for building diabetes diagnosis models. Researchers and healthcare professionals can use this dataset to train and test machine learning models to predict and diagnose diabetes in patients.
